## Introduction

Scrawl is an arcade game that takes you on a journey through difficulties of inner research and growth.

## Start a new game

The game starts with the player's avatar, made of scrawls, bound by ropes. The player needs to cut the ropes that bind the avatar to start the game.
Once the avatar is free, it enters a black and white stylized world, resembling a desert, with obstacles in the form of life events present to the avatar.

</p>

## Goal of the game

The player must help the avatar survive in the desert by avoiding obstacles and finding resources. As the avatar wanders through the desert, random figures will appear. The player must hide in the shadows of desert's objects that project shadows on the ground, waiting for the figure to disappear.
As the player hides behind the column, a mental sanity bar will start to feather away.

</p>

## End of the game

If the bar reaches zero, the player will be bound as in the main screen, and the game will be over.

## Score System

While the player explores the desert, the distance from the starting point will be used to calculate the score.

## The Research behind the game

The desert is connected to Hopi culture of inner research and growth, and randomly Kachina will appear during the avatar's wandering. Kachina will grant special skills for surviving in the desert.

</p>

## Game difficulty

As the avatar walks further into the desert, the player will encounter more significant challenges and obstacles. The game will become more challenging, and the player needs to be more strategic and careful to help the avatar survive.
The goal of the game is to help the avatar survive as long as possible while exploring the desert.
